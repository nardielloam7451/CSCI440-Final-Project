# CSCI 440 - Database Systems

This is the base upstream repository for CSCI 440.  It contains homeworks as well as the class project 
information.

## Branching

After you check this repository out, please create a branch based on your email and **work in that
directory**:

```shell script
$ git checkout -b <your email>@montana.edu # creates and switches to the branch
```

Do **NOT** work in the master directory.  We will only be pulling the branch named after your email
in our grading system and **will not see** any work you do in any other branches.

## Homeworks

Each homework has it's own directory (`/hwk0`, `/hwk1`, etc.).  Please do your work in the homework directory

## Project: TBD

You will be implementing a web application against a SQL store, found in `/db/chinook.db`

Details coming soon.
